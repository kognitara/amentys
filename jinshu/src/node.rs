/// The `TrieNode` struct represents a node in the Merkle tree of the filesystem. Each `TrieNode` occupies 4096 bytes, which is exactly 8 standard `Nvme` sectors of 512 bytes.
///
/// The structure is designed to be aligned to 4096 bytes to ensure efficient access and manipulation on `Nvme` devices.
///
/// # Fields
/// - `mask`: A 16-bit mask indicating which branches are present in the node.
/// - `opcode`: An 8-bit field representing the operation code for the node's recipe.
/// - `flags`: An 8-bit field for additional flags related to the node's operation.
/// - `param`: A 32-bit parameter that can be used in conjunction with the opcode for various operations.
/// - `branches`: An array of 16 Nouns, each representing a branch in the Merkle tree. Each Noun is a 32-byte cryptographic identity.
/// - `payload`: A 3576-byte array that holds the data or recipe associated with the node. The size is calculated to ensure that the total size of the `TrieNode` is 4096 bytes, accounting for the other fields.
/// # Alignment
/// The `TrieNode` is aligned to 4096 bytes to match the size of a standard `Nvme` sector, ensuring that each node can be read or written in a single operation without crossing sector boundaries. This alignment is crucial for performance and data integrity when interacting with `Nvme` devices.
